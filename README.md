Title: Analysis of the Detroit Blight Occurrences using Neural Net Predictors
Overview
The analysis was primarily done using R-Caret library which provides re-useable components for predictive analysis. Data preparation was done using SQL fucntions in Mysql database
From the analysis that was done, it was found out that there are key features that can be used to predict occurrence of blight. This includes fines that were levelled to occupants of buildings which could determine the nature of violation that had occurred in the building.
I also proceeded to perform Geographic clustering of violations to determine which buildings were affected and there were Clusters and from this it seems key areas that stand out in terms of blight incidences occurrence include the areas of Dearborn Heights, Highland Park hence areas around this region were likely to have incidences of blight.
There were also outliers in the data as can be seen with the cases reported in area of Chicago in the below visual.
